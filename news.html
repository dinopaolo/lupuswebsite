				<h1>First UK Guidelines for Management of Lupus in Adults Published</h1>
				<p>Lupus affects nearly 1 in 1,000 people in the UK, a large proportion of whom are female. 
				It can affect any part of the body, presenting differently in each case. It is often difficult 
				to diagnose and treat. Lupus has a major impact on the health and lifestyle of patients and in rare 
				cases can unfortunately result in premature death.</p>
				
				<p>The eagerly awaited guideline covers diagnosis, assessment, monitoring and treatment of patients 
				with mild, moderate and severe lupus. Whilst primarily aimed at rheumatologists and clinical nurse 
				specialists in lupus, nephrologists, immunologists, dermatologists, emergency medicine practitioners, 
				GPs and many trainees will also use the guideline.</p>
				
				<p>Chris Maker, CEO of LUPUS UK said: “The diagnosis and treatment of patients with lupus in the UK has 
				often been inconsistent, with those seeking a diagnosis often facing delays of several years and 
				experiencing uncertainty about their treatment. We hope that the implementation of the Guideline 
				will reduce the current diagnosis times and result in earlier access to appropriate treatment, 
				reducing flares and, ultimately, giving a better quality of life for patients.”</p>

				<h1>New UK Childhood Lupus Study</h1>
				<p>We are pleased to let you know that the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit has recently opened a new study looking at 
				childhood lupus (Juvenile-onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, JSLE). This study will be helping us to find out how many children 
				and young people are affected by lupus in the UK and Ireland. We will also be looking at what features of the disease are present, 
				how well our existing classification criteria work and which medical teams look after children and young people with lupus. </p>
				
				<p>Each month the BPSU sends an orange card to almost 3,500 consultant paediatricians and specialists; 
				the card lists the rare conditions currently being studied. If any doctor has seen a child affected by one of 
				these conditions they tick a box on the card and send it back. The BPSU informs the research team who send the 
				doctor a short confidential questionnaire asking for more information. Researchers are not told the names and addresses of 
				patients, and families are not contacted.</p>
